# About TLhC #
PHP is a great scripting language for this project.  I just wrote a few scripts that do something useful for me.  You might want them if you were also getting familiar with php and wanted some scripts that already do the thing I set out to do.  Which is making selling similar collectible items on eaby easier to maintain the same look and feel and very simple to put in information.
