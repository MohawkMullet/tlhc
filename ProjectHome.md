<h1>Introduction</h1>

TLhC is designed as a TurboLister addon product for <b>advanced computer users</b>.<br>
TLhC can be used with or without TurboLister.

TLhC runs on apache & mysql. <br>
The software generates <b>consistent product listings*</b>. The html code generated is suitable for pasting into Ebay, Etsy, TurboLister, Auctiva, or other listing software.  Consistency facilitates brand awareness and professionalism. Buyers see you are a reliable and quality seller when all of your listings follow the same
easy to read and reliable format.  Each item will list the same information in the same place.  Providing a
good experience for shoppers.  The comfort of knowing where to locate desired product descriptions is vital
to return sales.  TLhC helps you promote your brand better than any other listing software available.  


<b>*</b>TLhC was created to solve some of the problems TurboLister has.  Although <b>TurboLister is promoted</b> as able to create <b>"professional-looking listings"</b>. This is an area where TurboLister quickly falls behind.  Templates in TurboLister easily lose formatting and fall apart with the smallest of edits.  Editing the TurboLister HTML is a nightmare.  Templates don't stay formatted and I've spent far too many hours trying to fix the HTML output of TurbloLister to keep my Ebay listings looking consistent and professional.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TLhC was designed for listing collectible items mostly rare and valued by collectors.  Explicit terminology is
often used to describe the products description. Abbrieviations and certain nonmencature are used and known
among collectors and sellers and can be easily communicated once learned.

This software was designed for listing items where the strictest and most conservative language is used to 
describe similar items.  Each and every detail from the packaging to the condition of each part of the object
is observed and described when necessary.

TLhC was designed to expertly allow the <b>re-use of common descriptions</b> for items in similar condition by selecting them from your database. TLhC 
is a form based product lister that outputs valid HTML for ebay.

WHAT IT SOLVES

If you've ever used TL frustrations immediately evident.

TLhC was written to eliminate the need to use Turbolister as a template engine or an html editor.  The html code generated is poor.  Turbolister also loses the formatting of templates quickly.   TurboLister templates are inconsistent and difficult to use.

  * Other listing managers are also difficult to use and many contain ads.

Multiple listings can be created quickly and put into a batch uploader like TurboLister for publishing.

How it works:

> The user selects a template for their auction.

> The seller uploads a scan of the 45 for sale via the TLhC interface.

> Item details are added in the TLhC listing form.  (shown below)


> 4.  The form is submitted and a preview is generated along with the HTML code for the auction listing.

> 5.  The TLhC code can then be pasted into an auction batch listing application such as TurboLister or directly into eBay.

TLhC generates an item listing as HTML code along with a live preview.  A template is selected and the form is populated with the item specifics.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

The anatomy of a 45 listing:

Each 45 rpm record single has two main categories to describe the product.  The contents of the record and the condition of the item.  The first features information about the audio recording. ie Artist, songs, record company, and date of pressing.  The second describes the physical condition of the vinyl and sleeve.  This is where TLhC becomes valuable.  The condition of the record is also known as the grade.   Each record is given an overall letter grade to start off.  Then more detailed specific comments about the contents and physical record quality are included.


The main TLhC input form has 5 or so main categories.  Each unique item detail is manually entered into the main form.  Categories to describe the physical condition of the product are chosen from a preloaded in list.


Commonly used item descriptors are entered then saved in a MySQL database.  The phrase is immediately added to the form with Ajax.  It can then be selected from HTML form elements.
