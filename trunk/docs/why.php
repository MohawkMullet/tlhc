      <h3>TLhC? Who's it for? </h3> 
      <p>
       TLhC is designed for ebay sellers who list <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px">lots of similar</span> items and want all their listings to share a default style and structure. </p>
      <p>With TLhC a seller uses a simple web form to input their item specifics, choose from predefined comments, and add other components. It then generates a preview of your item listing along with the html code to be pasted into TL. </p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>I sell collectible 45 rmp vinyl records on ebay. A 45 listing on ebay is fairly simple. It consists of item specifics (Singer, Side A, Side B) and  the condition of the item (New, Worn, Scratched). Pretty simple. Each 45 listing consists of all or some of the same parts. Pretty easy to see that one could get tired of typing &quot;Side A:&quot; over and over again for each listing. </p>
      <p>Yes I tried using templates in TL. As a matter of fact I still do, but now they mainly contain category information. Editing a description in TL is tedious and unreliable. Formatting gets lost and html tags seem to just disappear. I wanted to be able to just copy and paste my finished html code into turbo lister and avoid using it for inputting item details. </p>
      <p>Decription phrases about the condition  are reused frequently. And each listing contains a very structured set of item specifics.</p>
      <p>Anyone who's spent much time working with TL knows that editing your listings via it's internal Description Builder leaves room for sloppy html code and uneven results.  I've tried to put together most of the basic scripts I use in a generic package that can be customized. Some knowledge of HTML is probably needed. PHP knowledge is probably not critical. I've setup some pretty cool forms with plenty of output variables that have plenty of options. You can find us on ebay at http://hepvinyl.com . We sell 45's. </p>
