 <h1>Editing the Config File</h1>
 <p> The config file is located at /parts/config.php</p>
 <p>You need to edit several values in this file to make the scripts in TLhC ouput the correct information for your listings.</p>
 <p>Store Name: This is where you are going to put in the name of your ebay store. Example: If your store was named: &quot;My Used Shoes&quot; you would change the line to look like this</p>
 <p>$storeName = &quot;My Used Shoes&quot;;</p>
 <p>Basically just type your store name between the quotes &quot; &quot; and leave the quotes and the semicolon and the end.</p>
