#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

I'm not much of a programmer.  I just wrote a few scripts that do something useful for me.  You might want them if you were also getting familiar with php and wanted some scripts that already do the thing I set out to do.  Which is making selling similar collectible items on eaby easier to maintain the same look and feel and very simple to put in information.

This is for people who hate editing their templates in turbo lister.  if you have a standard listing style and sell items often in the same categories, etc these php scripts will run on an apache server and take form input and then generate html code that can be cut and pasted into turblolister or joalt or whatever listing tool you use.


REQUIREMENTS:
