      <h3>TLhC? Who's it for? </h3> 
      <p>
       TLhC is designed for ebay sellers who list lots of similar items and want all their listings to look professional and the same. TLhC allows a seller to use a simple web form to input their item specifics quickly and easily. It then generates a preview along with the html code to be pasted into TurboLister. </p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>Anyone who's spent much time working with TL knows that editing your listings via it's internal Description Builder leaves room for sloppy html code and uneven results.  I've tried to put together most of the basic scripts I use in a generic package that can be customized. Knowledge of HTML is probably needed. PHP knowledge is probably not critical. I've setup some pretty complex forms with plenty of output variables that have plenty of options. You can find us on ebay at http://hepvinyl.com . We sell 45's. </p>
