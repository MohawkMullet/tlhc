# tlhc
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/tlhc
The Version 2.4.0? over at google code worked perfectly for me when I downloaded the zip.
I currently use openSuse 13.2 and apache/mariadb that come down through the repositories.
There is a database file to upload in the docs/install folder.  create mysql database 
named tlhc drop in the sample data
change the username and password in the file parts/config.php and the scripts should work.
2015-09-02 I am working on transferring over here to github and I have a new version
with new tabs to upload.  One tab for selling Rock & Roll posters and another
tab for selling toy model train cars and parts.

Please feel free to email me.  I'd be happy to help anyone that can get the scripts working for what
ever reason they need.
